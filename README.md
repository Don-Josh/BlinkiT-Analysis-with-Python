## DATA CLEANING

There were irregularities under the "Item Fat Content" 

Low Fat, low Fat and LF are referring to same thing as Low Fat

while reg and Regular are the same thing

Data Cleaning was needed to clean the column and making all the irregularities to become uniform ('Low Fat' and 'Regular') in other to make our Analysis acurrate.

## Recommendations and Conclusions

#### Focus on High-Demand Categories
Prioritize inventory and promotions for top-performing categories: Fruits & Vegetables, Snack Foods, Household Items, Frozen Food, and Dairy.

Introduce bundle deals or loyalty programs for these categories to maximize sales volume.

#### Revamp Low-Performing Product Lines
Reassess marketing strategy or shelf space allocation for underperforming categories like Hard Drinks, Starchy Foods, Breakfast Items, and Seafood.

Consider limited-time offers or customer feedback surveys to identify barriers to purchase.

#### Promote Low-Fat Product Lines
Leverage the higher patronage of low-fat options by launching health-focused campaigns.

Add “healthy choice” labels and create separate filters or categories to improve discoverability.

#### Leverage Customer Ratings
Maintain or improve the average rating of 4 by:

Ensuring accurate product descriptions,

Prompt delivery,

Offering post-purchase support.

#### Expand Successful Outlet Models
Replicate the 2018 outlet model, as it generated the highest revenue. Evaluate what worked—location, management style, or demographic reach—and replicate those elements in newer outlets.

#### Invest More in Supermarket Type 1
Since Supermarket Type 1 consistently outperforms others, allocate more resources, marketing efforts, and inventory stock to this outlet type.

Consider converting low-performing outlet types into Type 1 formats, if feasible.

#### Maximize Reach in Tier 3 Locations
With Tier 3 outlets leading in performance, increase delivery capacity, warehouse presence, and hyper-local advertising in these regions.

Explore expansion into similar Tier 3 cities with untapped potential.
